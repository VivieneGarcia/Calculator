# Calculator

The calculator project is currently in progress as a means of learning C++.

The current version of the calculator project includes the following functionalities:

- Users can input two numbers and choose from basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

- The program allows users to input multiple simple expressions until they decide to quit. The limit for the number of expressions they can input is set to 10,000.

- Enables users to selectively view specific information from the computations, including num1, num2, operation used, result, or the entire computation list.

- Data Validation and Error Handling
